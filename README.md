# Vector-With-Dynamic-Arrays
Making the features of vectors for the arrays
This code has most fatures of vectors for the array 
The features is :
      1- push_back
      2- pop_back
      3- insert
      4- erase (with just the position)
      5- erase (with a range of values)
      6- clear
      7- size
--> so most of these features in the vector , so what is the matter of making it for arrays
